### ðŸ§ª ESLint Configuration

#### Extending Configuration for Production

For a production application, it's recommended to extend the ESLint configuration for type-aware lint rules. Here is how you can do it:

1. Update the `parserOptions` in your ESLint config like so:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  ecmaVersion: 'latest',
  sourceType: 'module',
  project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
  tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
},
